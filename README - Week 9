433B - Kuriyama Mirai's Stones

From this problem, we are given a number of stones, each of the stones have their own prices.
The questions that is possible from the problem are type one and two:
The first type will be the total of stone's cost from l to r and the second type will be the total of
The cost of the stones from l to r in an non-decreasing order.
The first line input will be the number of the stones that followed by cost of each stones.
Then it is followed with how many questions will their be. Each question consists of type, l, and r. The output is the sum of numbers from l to r according its type.

913C - Party Lemonade

From this problem, we have to find the cheapest cost to fullfill the lemonade liters needed.
Each bottle have different volume and different cost too, and the volume of the i-th bottle will be 2i-1 liters.
You can buy more than a bottle with the same volume. You can have more lemonade in liters than the required number.
The first input will be the number of the bottle types and the required lemonade in liters.
The second input will be the price of the i-th bottle.
The output is to print thew money that we spend to accomplish the required lemonade.
The first solution here is to store the cost for each type of bottle. 
Then, we will check if we can buy 2 bottle of smaller type of bottle with cheaper price rather than 1 bottle with higher price.
Then after all done we loop all the bottles from the highest liters down to the smallest liters.
Then we will see is it cheaper to buy 2 of the biggest bottle if it is still left to fullfill or 1 bottle and other bottle to fullfill the need of the lemonade.
